## Contributing

We highly encourage participation from the community to help shape the development of DeFi Basket. If you are interested in
contributing or have any questions, ping us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/defibasketlabs) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/5AVTGwkCEs);

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a dependency manager and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
as a development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying our contracts. The contracts were written in [Solidity v0.8.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity),
and their interfaces are explained in our [documentation for developers](https://docs.defibasket.org/indexpool/developer/architecture).
