## Running Locally

You will first need to run a local node in your machine. You can do that with Hardhat using:

```
npx hardhat node
```

After that, you can run our script responsible for deploying all our contracts with a default configuration. It will be created some initial options and pools with liquidity there.

```
npx hardhat setupLocal --network local
```

## Contributing

We highly encourage participation from the community to help shape the development of Pods. If you are interested in
contributing or have any questions, ping us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/indexpool) or [Discord](https://discord.com);

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a dependency manager and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
as a development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying our contracts. The contracts were written in [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity).
